Never heard of it? Perhaps [this article can help you](https://www.thunknotes.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-garden).

I'm **Anthony** and I usually go by **Nyferin** on online forums. I'm a wayfarer who got passionate to experience the **wizardry of technology**. Thus, I went to the prestigious **Satya Wacana Christian University** to learn more about the arts of computer and techs. Spells I've learned:
- C,
- C++, 
- Java, 
- Python, 
- PHP,
- Linux,
- Computer Network,
- and other bunch of stuffs related to techs and ethics.

Nevertheless I still yearn to explore the vast information of computer. Currently, I'm on my pursuit to excel the **dark arts of cybersecurity** from my university masters and online resources.
